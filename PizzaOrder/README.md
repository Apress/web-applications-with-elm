So what is our example application? Let's assume we have the task to develop an online pizza order web app. It is for the internal use of pizza employees who take orders over phone or in the restaurant. We assume that all orders - once confirmed - will be sent to the kitchen and the pizza cooks will go ahead to bake the ordered pizze.

The requirements are:

* Choose a pizza from a drop down list. Unavailable pizze should be greyed out.
* Once a pizza is chosen additional toppings can be added, dependent on the selection in the dropdown list.
* The price updates dynamically depending on pizza and toppings selection.
* It is possible to choose more than one pizza for each order.
* There are name, address and phone fields with validation for the phone field for telephone orders.
* Depending on address and pizza selection an approximate delivery time will be displayed.
* We assume payment on delivery.
* Submitting the form updates an order list that is displayed in the dashboard of the app.
